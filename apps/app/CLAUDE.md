# apps/app

## Purpose
Vite + React 19 SPA. The authenticated dashboard — signup, login, and all post-auth product UI (billing, settings). Runs on port 3000. All API calls proxy to `apps/api` on port 3001 via the Vite dev server.

## Conventions
- All env access through `src/lib/env.ts` (validated via `@t3-oss/env-core`) — never `import.meta.env.VITE_*` directly
- All API calls must include `credentials: 'include'` — session auth is cookie-based
- Auth state via `useSession()` from `src/lib/auth.ts` — never manage session state manually
- Dashboard pages must be nested inside the `/dashboard` route in `router.tsx` so `ProtectedRoute` + `DashboardLayout` wrap them automatically

## Common tasks

### Add a new dashboard page
1. Create `src/routes/dashboard/<name>.tsx`
2. Add a `<Route>` inside the `/dashboard` parent in `router.tsx`
3. Add a nav item to `navItems()` in `src/routes/dashboard/layout.tsx` with `href:` and `active:` fields

### Add a new API call
Use `useQuery` or `useMutation` from TanStack Query. Fetch against `${env.VITE_API_URL}/<endpoint>` with `credentials: 'include'`.

### Enable Google sign-in
Add a button calling `signIn.social({ provider: 'google', callbackURL: '/dashboard' })`. No other config needed here — Google OAuth activates in `packages/auth` when the env vars are set.

### Browse the component library
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/_dev/components` in dev mode. This route is tree-shaken from production builds.

## Gotchas
- Dev server: port 3000. The Vite proxy forwards `/api/*` to `http://localhost:3001` — both servers must be running for auth to work
- Billing price IDs come from `GET /billing/config` (server env `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY` / `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID_YEARLY`) — set these in `apps/api/.env` before launch
- `src/routes/dashboard/settings.tsx` profile update is a stub — the mutation is not wired
- The `/_dev/components` route only exists in dev; it is absent from production builds
